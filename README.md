An automated application to automatically place orders when items come into stock such as GPU's as fast as possible to order before others get the items. In the end it did end up working in terms of being able to add items to cart and order but there were other faster bots on the amazon website which beat my own bot I wrote, the closest I got was adding the item to cart and going to the checkout page, but after the "checkout" button was pressed the item would be added to the wishlist as the item would have been bought by another bot or user before our bot could checkout.
